# Use Case Instructions

Download the data and unzip the ecoli reference file by running 
```
git clone https://github.com/AfZheng126/MORA-data.git
cd MORA-data/ecoli_data
gunzip ecoli.fna.gz
```

To go the configuration file for Mora make sure the directories are correct. If MORA-data was downloaded in the same directory where MORA was downlaoded, the config file shouldn't need to be changed.
